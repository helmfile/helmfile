# Issue #2431: Local chart with external dependencies
# 
# helmfile.yaml has repos configured (vector), but the local chart has dependencies
# on a repository that is NOT configured here.
#
# This test verifies that helm dep build does NOT receive --skip-refresh
# for local charts, allowing them to refresh repos for external dependencies.

repositories:
  - name: vector
    url: https://helm.vector.dev

releases:
  - name: karma

    chart: ./karma
