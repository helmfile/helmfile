Deploy Kubernetes Helm Charts

## About

Helmfile is a declarative spec for deploying helm charts. It lets you...

* Keep a directory of chart value files and maintain changes in version control.
* Apply CI/CD to configuration changes.
* Periodically sync to avoid skew in environments.

To avoid upgrades for each iteration of `helm`, the `helmfile` executable delegates to `helm` - as a result, `helm` must be installed.

## Highlights

**Declarative**: Write, version-control, apply the desired state file for visibility and reproducibility.

**Modules**: Modularize common patterns of your infrastructure, distribute it via Git, S3, etc. to be reused across the entire company (See [#648](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/pull/648))

**Versatility**: Manage your cluster consisting of charts, [kustomizations](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize), and directories of Kubernetes resources, turning everything to Helm releases (See [#673](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/pull/673))

**Patch**: JSON/Strategic-Merge Patch Kubernetes resources before `helm-install`ing, without forking upstream charts (See [#673](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/pull/673))

## Status

March 2022 Update - The helmfile project has been moved to [helmfile/helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) from the former home `roboll/helmfile`. Please see roboll/helmfile#1824 for more information.

Even though Helmfile is used in production environments [across multiple organizations](USERS.md), it is still in its early stage of development, hence versioned 0.x.

Helmfile complies to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 in which v0.x means that there could be backward-incompatible changes for every release.

Note that we will try our best to document any backward incompatibility. And in reality, helmfile had no breaking change for a year or so.


## Installation

**1: Binary Installation**

download one of [releases](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/releases)

**2: Package Manager**

* Archlinux: install via `pacman -S helmfile`
* openSUSE: install via `zypper in helmfile` assuming you are on Tumbleweed; if you are on Leap you must add the [kubic](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic/) repo for your distribution version once before that command, e.g. `zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic/openSUSE_Leap_\$releasever kubic`
* Windows (using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)): `scoop install helmfile`
* macOS (using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)): `brew install helmfile`

**3: Container**

For more details, see [run as a container](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#running-as-a-container)

> Make sure to run `helmfile init` once after installation. Helmfile uses the [helm-diff](https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff) plugin.

## Getting Started

Let's start with a simple `helmfile` and gradually improve it to fit your use-case!

Suppose the `helmfile.yaml` representing the desired state of your helm releases looks like:

```yaml
repositories:
- name: prometheus-community
  url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

releases:
- name: prom-norbac-ubuntu
  namespace: prometheus
  chart: prometheus-community/prometheus
  set:
  - name: rbac.create
    value: false
```

Sync your Kubernetes cluster state to the desired one by running:

```console
helmfile apply
```

Congratulations! You now have your first Prometheus deployment running inside
 your cluster.
