-                                     non-empty, they must have the same value. For
-                                     backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t
-                                     specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
-                                     and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
-                                     automatically if one of them is empty and the
-                                     other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
-                                     in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
-                                     same value and must be empty. There are three
-                                     important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
-                                     * While dataSource only allows two specific types
-                                     of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
-                                     object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
-                                     * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
-                                     them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
-                                     generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
-                                     * While dataSource only allows local objects,
-                                     dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

-                                   objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
-                                   (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
-                                   and generates an error if a disallowed value is
-                                   specified. * While dataSource only allows local
-                                   objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

-                         volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource

-                         is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the

-                                     * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
-                                     them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
-                                     generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
-                                     * While dataSource only allows local objects,

-                                   (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
-                                   and generates an error if a disallowed value is
-                                   specified. * While dataSource only allows local

-                                     * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
-                                     them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
-                                     generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
